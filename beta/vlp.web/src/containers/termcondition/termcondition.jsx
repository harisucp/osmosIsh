                                    <p>Our services comprise an online platform through which Teachers are able to create classes and Students
                                            can book a session. You understand and agree that Osmos-ish is not a service for Teachers to promote
                                            their own freelance tutoring services. Osmos-ish has no control over the conduct of Teachers, Tutors,

                                    <h4>Non-Employment</h4>
                                    <p>  By using Osmos-ish, Teachers are using our platform as an independent contractor and are not paid
                                    salaries, or benefits. Unlike an employee, Osmos-ish allows Teachers the flexibility to create their own
                                    schedule and set their own rates.
                                        </p>

                                    <p>Osmos-ish makes available a platform with related technology for Teacher, Tutors and Students to meet
                                            online and arrange live, online classes. We are not a moderator - our services are intended to be used to
                                            facilitate a productive learning environment. Osmos-ish cannot and does not control the content taught in

                                            classes taught. Accordingly, all classes are made at the Teacher, Tutor and Student’s own risk.

                                    <p>Should any issues arise between the Teacher/Tutor and Student, a formal message must be sent
                                    immediately notifying the other party of the claim. Both parties have 30 days in good faith to try and
                                    resolve said issue. If after 30 days from the date of the claim, both parties are unable to come to a
                                    resolution, issues will be left for an arbitrator to decide. The claimant is responsible for filing an

                                                construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration: rather, the AAA’s rules
                                                will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under the Agreement
                                                to Arbitrate. The parties agree to reimburse the prevailing party’s reasonable arbitration costs, and all
                                                other expenses, whether or not taxable by the court as costs, in addition to any other relief to which the
                                                prevailing Party may be entitled.</p>
                                    <h4>Amendments</h4>

                                                Should Osmos-ish modify these terms, information about the modification(s) will either be posted on the

                                    <h4>Governing Law</h4>
                                    <p>This Contract shall be governed by, and construed under the laws of the State of California. The user
